# M-Mart+ Deployment and Fix Documentation

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### Authentication Endpoint Fixes
- **API Endpoint Mismatch**: Updated frontend to use the correct backend API endpoints
  - Login route updated from `/login` to `/auth/login`
  - Registration route updated from `/register` to `/auth/register`
  - Fixed in both `authService.ts` and `AuthContext.tsx`
  - Resolved "The route api/login could not be found" error

### Environment Configuration Corrections
- **Duplicate API Path Segments**: Fixed environment variables to prevent double `/api` paths
  - Updated `.env` and `.env.local` files to use `http://api.m-martplus.com` (without trailing `/api`)
  - Corrected default `baseUrl` in `config.ts` to ensure proper API URL construction
  - Ensured consistent URL patterns across development and production environments

### Form Submission Fixes
- **422 Unprocessable Content for Registration**: 
  - Mapped frontend form fields to match backend expectations
  - Backend expects: name, email, phone_number, password, password_confirmation
  - Frontend was sending: first_name, last_name, email, password, password_confirmation
  - Added phone field to the registration form
  - Enhanced error logging for validation errors

### Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Fixes
- **CORS Policy Error for Email Verification**:
  - Updated CORS configuration on Digital Ocean server to include Vercel deployment domains
  - Created update scripts for CORS configuration changes
  - Fixed email verification process
