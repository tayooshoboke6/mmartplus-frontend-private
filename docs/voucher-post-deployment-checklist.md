# Post-Deployment Voucher System Validation Checklist

This checklist should be completed after deploying the voucher system to production. It provides a comprehensive verification of all voucher functionality to ensure a smooth customer experience.

## Initial Health Check

- [ ] **API Health:**
  - [ ] Verify `/vouchers/validate` endpoint returns 200 OK for valid requests
  - [ ] Verify `/orders/apply-voucher` endpoint returns 200 OK for valid requests
  - [ ] Average API response time is under 300ms for all voucher endpoints

- [ ] **Database Health:**
  - [ ] Voucher tables have correct indices and constraints
  - [ ] No database connection errors in logs
  - [ ] Queries complete within expected timeframes

- [ ] **Frontend Health:**
  - [ ] Voucher entry field appears correctly on cart page
  - [ ] Voucher cards render properly in the admin dashboard
  - [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console

## Functional Validation

### Customer-Facing Features

- [ ] **Voucher Entry:**
  - [ ] Enter a valid voucher code → Discount applies correctly
  - [ ] Enter an invalid voucher code → Appropriate error message displayed
  - [ ] Enter a voucher with minimum purchase requirement (when cart is below minimum) → Correct error message
  - [ ] Enter an expired voucher → "Expired voucher" message displayed
  - [ ] Apply voucher, then remove items to go below minimum purchase → Warning displayed

- [ ] **Discount Display:**
  - [ ] Percentage discount → Correct amount calculated and displayed
  - [ ] Fixed amount discount → Correct amount applied
  - [ ] Discount line item appears in order summary
  - [ ] Discount persists through checkout process

- [ ] **Order Completion:**
  - [ ] Complete checkout with voucher → Order confirmation shows correct discount
  - [ ] Voucher usage count increments in database
  - [ ] Voucher with usage limit → Becomes unavailable after limit reached
  - [ ] Order history shows voucher discount correctly

### Admin Features

- [ ] **Voucher Management:**
  - [ ] Create a new voucher → Appears in voucher list
  - [ ] Edit voucher details → Changes save correctly
  - [ ] Deactivate voucher → No longer valid for customers
  - [ ] Delete voucher → Removed from system

- [ ] **Reporting:**
  - [ ] Voucher usage report shows accurate counts
  - [ ] Discount totals match order records
  - [ ] Filter by date ranges works correctly
  - [ ] Export report data functions properly

- [ ] **API Monitor:**
  - [ ] Verify the API monitoring dashboard loads correctly
  - [ ] Confirm real-time updates of API calls
  - [ ] Error reporting works when invalid vouchers are tested
  - [ ] Performance metrics accurately display response times

## Edge Case Testing

- [ ] **Concurrency:**
  - [ ] Multiple customers apply limited voucher simultaneously → Only permissible number succeed
  - [ ] Rapid sequential applications → Each handled correctly

- [ ] **Timeout Handling:**
  - [ ] Simulate slow responses → Frontend shows appropriate loading state
  - [ ] Retry mechanism works when temporary errors occur

- [ ] **Error Recovery:**
  - [ ] Network interruption during voucher application → State recovers correctly
  - [ ] Session timeout during checkout → Voucher persists when user logs back in

- [ ] **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
  - [ ] Voucher functionality works in Chrome
  - [ ] Voucher functionality works in Firefox
  - [ ] Voucher functionality works in Safari
  - [ ] Voucher functionality works in Edge
  - [ ] Voucher functionality works on mobile browsers

## Security Verification

- [ ] **Authentication & Authorization:**
  - [ ] Non-admin users cannot access voucher management
  - [ ] Voucher API endpoints require proper authentication
  - [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force voucher code attempts

- [ ] **Input Validation:**
  - [ ] Special characters in voucher code field handled properly
  - [ ] XSS attempts in voucher fields are blocked
  - [ ] SQL injection attempts are blocked

- [ ] **Data Protection:**
  - [ ] Voucher usage data anonymized appropriately
  - [ ] Sensitive voucher data (like unique links) properly protected
  - [ ] API responses don't leak internal system details

## Performance Testing

- [ ] **Load Testing:**
  - [ ] System handles expected peak voucher validation rate
  - [ ] Response time remains acceptable under load
  - [ ] No degradation of other services when voucher system is under load

- [ ] **Resource Utilization:**
  - [ ] Database query performance is optimized
  - [ ] API memory usage remains within acceptable limits
  - [ ] No memory leaks observed during extended testing

## Recovery Testing

- [ ] **Failure Recovery:**
  - [ ] Database connection failure → System recovers gracefully
  - [ ] API service restart → Vouchers continue to function
  - [ ] Cache invalidation → Voucher status updates properly

## Post-Launch Monitoring Plan

- [ ] Monitor voucher API response times for the first 24 hours
- [ ] Review error logs every 2 hours for the first day
- [ ] Check voucher usage patterns against projections
- [ ] Conduct first customer satisfaction survey after 1 week
